# Data-Challenge

## Overview

Thank you for expressing interest in the Inference Data Scientist position at Gust.
This challenge is designed to test your familiarity with SQL (of the postgres flavor). When answering these questions please provide the Query used to reach the answer as well as the answer itself.

## Setting up

- You will need Postgresql 9.1 or higher to access the data, you can download postgres by following the instructions [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Once you have postgres installed you can download the dataset we created for the challenge. Click this [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gust-data-challenge/pg_dump_file) and the data `pg_dump_file` file should download
- Using your terminal, create a new database called gust_challenge using the `createdb` command ` createdb gust_challenge` (depending on your setup you may need to specify the database host, port and user to run the command)
- Load the data located in the downloaded `pg_dump_file` into the newly created database by running ` psql -d gust_challenge < pg_dump_file` (once again, you may need to specify the database host, port and user to run the command)
- You can access the database by running the `psql` command (possibly with the host, port and user specified)
